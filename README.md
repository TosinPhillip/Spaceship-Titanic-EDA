# Spaceship Titanic EDA
This repo contains a submision for a Kaggle.com classification challenge. The submission achieved a 78% accuracy score on the leaderborad.

 A special/altered titanic dataset (a future version of the well-known Titanic ship, but this time a spacrship) aimed at just teaching Exploratory Data Analysis. The major focus is EDA but classification is also done (to predict if the individual is transported or not).
